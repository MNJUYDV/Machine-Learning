# CNN for Image Classification

This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for classifying images of dogs and cats and testing if the model makes correct predictions. The model is trained on a dataset containing labeled images of dogs and cats and is evaluated on a separate test dataset to measure its accuracy.

## Project Overview

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are widely used in image classification tasks due to their ability to automatically learn hierarchical features from raw pixel data. In this project, we leverage CNNs to classify images of dogs and cats into their respective categories. The trained model is then used to make predictions on unseen images to assess its performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of a collection of labeled images of dogs and cats. The dataset may be obtained from public sources, such as Kaggle datasets or academic repositories, or through data scraping methods from image sharing platforms.

## Model Architecture

The CNN architecture used for image classification typically consists of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. The specific architecture may vary depending on the complexity of the dataset and the desired performance. Common architectures include VGG, ResNet, and Inception.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/CNN-for-image-Classification.git
Install the required dependencies (e.g., TensorFlow, Keras).

Preprocess the dataset (e.g., resizing images, normalizing pixel values).

Train the CNN model using the preprocessed dataset.

Evaluate the trained model on a separate test dataset to measure its accuracy.

Use the trained model to make predictions on new images and assess its performance.
